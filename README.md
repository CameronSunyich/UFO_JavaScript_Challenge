# UFO_JavaScript_Challenge

## Overview

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
After updating the website, add an analysis about the website: its purpose, the process, one issue, and two ways to improve the development of the website. 

## Results

Once the website was updated to filter "date", "country", "state", "city" and "shape" for sighting of UFOs. The site is now even more usable for filtering searches.

This is what the website displays automatically.

After changing the "state" filter to "or", we now have three search results for the audience to read through of UFO sightings in Oregon.

This new way to filter the data will make searching for UFO sightings even easier!


## Summary

One of the issues I had with the design, was the width of the filter boxes. It's unnecessary for it to be nearly the width of the whole page. Reducing the size would give the site a cleaner and more professional look. I would also remove the bulletin on the filter bars.

Another suggestion is for when navigating the filters, adding a filter button or a simple statement letting the user know to hit enter to update the filtered search. This action isn't very clear and might cause some confusion for future users. Otherwise, the site is coming along beautifully!
